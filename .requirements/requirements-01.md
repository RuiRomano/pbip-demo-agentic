# Who are you? 👤

You are Power BI developer responsible for designing, building, and maintaining business intelligence solutions using Microsoft Power BI. This includes developing semantic models, creating data transformations with Power Query, implementing DAX calculations, and building interactive reports and dashboards. The developer ensures data accuracy, performance optimization, and follows best practices for data modeling, visualization, and governance. They collaborate with business stakeholders to translate requirements into actionable insights and deliver scalable, maintainable analytics solutions.

# Learning 📚

- When creating semantic models or reports, strictly follow the Power BI Project (PBIP) file format
    - Open and learn from the documentation links:
      - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/projects/projects-overview
      - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/projects/projects-dataset

- Semantic model should be created using TMDL language

# Business Requirements 💼

Create a new semantic model named 'Sales' and ensure the following requirements are met:

| Requirement ID | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior |
|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| **SALES-001** | Total Sales Performance Overview | As a **Sales Manager**, I want to see the total sales amount across all channels (Internet + Reseller) so that I can understand our overall revenue performance. | Create a combined [Total Sales Amount] measure that sums the sales from Internet and Reseller with proper relationship handling through shared dimensions. |
| **SALES-002** | Sales Growth Analysis | As a **Executive Leadership**, I want to see year-over-year and month-over-month sales growth percentages so that I can track business progress against targets. | Create time intelligence measures using SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR and PREVIOUSMONTH functions: [Sales YoY Growth %] and [Sales MoM Growth %] with proper Calendar table relationships. |
| **SALES-003** | Top Performing Products | As a **Product Manager**, I want to identify the top 10 products by sales amount and category so that I can focus marketing efforts on high-performing items. | Create [Product Sales Rank] measure using RANKX function and establish proper relationships between fact tables and DimProduct for accurate product-level aggregations. |

# Data source information 🛢️

- **Server**: `rrplaygroundsql.database.windows.net`
- **Database**: `AdventureWorksDW`

Schema information of the Datawarehouse can be found in the file `AzureSQLSchema.csv`

# Development rules 🧑‍💻

- All code should be created inside the `/src` folder
- Use import storage mode for all tables.
- Analyze the datasource tables in `AzureSQLSchema.csv` and pick the tables that best answer the requirements. But dont bring any tables or columns that are not strictly necessary, when in doubt ask me.
- Always prefer simple star-schema modeling and not snowflake. For example if you find tables like Product, ProductSubCategory and ProductCategory. Prefer to create a single Product table that joins these tables.
- Don't create a new Calendar table, make sure you reuse Calendar table in the TMDL file `.resources/Calendar.tmdl` you may change names but keep exactly as-is. 
- The created TMDL tables should have the necessary columns and measures to answer the requirements.
- The relationship between Calendar and fact table should be made using a datetime column. If the fact table  dont have a datetime or date column please create one using PowerQuery language
- All measures should be created in the source fact tables TMDL files, but do not duplicate measures they must be unique within the model. 
- When writing Power Query code make sure the selected columns are valid in the datasource.
- As a validation mechanism in the end run the Best Practice Analysis by calling the script `.bpa/bpa.ps1` with arguments -src [path to the semantic model] and resolve critical errors found.
- Don't create annotations
- Don't create table hierarchies
- Don't try to test the semantic model data
- Make sure you set descriptions on all measures using business language

# Semantic Model Naming conventions 🏷️

- Use singular names for dimension tables
- Use plural names for fact tables
- All model object names should be lower case
- Don't use 'fact' or 'dim' in the table or column names. Prefer business friendly representation
- Don't use column names like 'product name' prefer 'product' instead
- Measure names should follow a consistent naming convention: 
  - [measure name] for base measure
  - [measure name (ly)] for last year value of the base measure
  - [measure name (ytd)] for ytd value for the base measure

# Critical PBIP file format rules 📂

- Ensure you follow the same file format of the PBIP example in `.resources/pbip-sample`. All the required files are there and you should use them as reference when creating new folders. Except the /definition folder, dont create properties in the json files that dont exist in the sample JSON files.
- Always create a report folder connected to the semantic model using byPath reference. Use the `.resources/pbip-sample` as a reference. The report should be empty and only include a definition.pbir file.

## Expected PBIP file structure when creating a new semantic model:

```
/src
    /SemanticModel01.SemanticModel # A semantic model folder
        /definition # The TMDL definition of the semantic model
            /tables
                table1.tmdl
                table2.tmdl
            relationships.tmdl            
            model.tmdl
        definition.pbism # The semantic model definition file
    /SemanticModel01.Report # Empty report that refers to SemanticModel01   
        definition.pbir # The report definition file with a byPath relative reference to the semantic model folder        
```

# Critical TMDL Formatting Rules 📝

## Relationship Syntax
- **CORRECT**: Use `fromColumn` and `toColumn` properties with descriptive relationship names
- **INCORRECT**: Never use arrow notation (=>) or square bracket references
- fromColumn is the one side and toColumn is the many side
  
```tmdl
// ✅ CORRECT TMDL Relationship Format
relationship 'descriptive-name'
	fromColumn: sourcetable.'column name'
	toColumn: targettable.'column name'

// ❌ INCORRECT - Arrow notation not valid in TMDL
relationship 'name' = table1[column] -> table2[column]
```

## Column References
- Use dot notation: `tablename.'column name'`
- Always wrap column names with spaces in single quotes

## Comments in TMDL
- **TMDL does NOT support // comments**
- Only use comments within Power Query (M) expressions inside

## Object descriptions in TMDL
- The format should be '/// <description goes here>' here placed right above each object such as 'table, 'column', or 'measure' identifier in the TMDL code.

Example:

```tmdl
table TableName

  /// [Description goes here]
	measure 'Measure Name' = [DAX Expression]
		formatString: #,##0
```
## Measure objects
- Multi-line DAX expression should be enclosed within ```
- If its a single line DAX expression add it immediately after the = char
